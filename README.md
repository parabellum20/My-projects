# My-projects
This is a space where i share my hobby projects.
Project-1 
I had done this project during my sem holidays completely out of boredom. My inventory contained a fingerprint sensor and i was parallely learning ESP32. I wanted to create a hands-on project using ESP32, therefore i decided to create a prototype, which could sense motion around my door , and later based on fingerprint verification would intimate me the name of the person if the fingerprint is enrolled, otherwise it would intimate that someone unidentified is near my door. I have done extensive testing and debugging all by myself at my home workspace.
